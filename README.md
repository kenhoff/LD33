Game jam ideas! The theme is "You are the monster"

minotaur idea - adventurers are adventuring into the dungeon in order to steal treasure - dungeon keeper-esque, but single-player focused. you play the minotaur

something cthulu-y? i really like the idea of big incomprehensible horror. Limbo comes to mind, the bits with the spider - something predatory and slow-moving

MONSTER TRUCKS

TJ's idea: kill innocent woodland creatures. it automatically makes you a monster

something Godzilla-y - retro city rampage?

how else can I think about "you are the monster?"

# *you* are the monster

misdirection - you were the monster all along

# you *are* the monster

somewhat distinct from the first one? separation of

# you are *the* monster

The single, titular monster - Godzirra!

# you are the *monster*

Woo! fuck yeah! the *monster*! monster jumps! monster cliffs! monster eater! monster as an adjective!


monty python monster! a group of adventurers trying to defeat a monster

or the tiny bunny monster! i like the idea of jumping at slow-moving bouncy knights - moving on to different classes of knights, catapults, eventually coming to take down the king
2d side-scrolling platformer

okay, i'm liking the feel of this one. have a press-and-hold to jump mechanic, so you get the idea of hopping along the ground, and also have the ability to leap into the air and onto knights

knights automatically flee for a few seconds when they see another knight get eaten, but the knight you're eating fights back and can knock you off if you stay on long enough

progression goes from left-to-right. come out of the cave, hop through the forest, get to the castle walls, in through the castle, and eventually take down the king. how hard can it be?

it's called....RODENT.
